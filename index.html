 <h1>Hello</h1>

    
    <p>My name is Mr Whisper, and I am a London based photographer who re-imagines the cultural sterotypes through the use of imagery.
    I want to showcase my daily travels and discoveries, and show you a glimse into the strange little occurances that happen within everyday life in some of the most amazing cities in the world. The fascinating sense that everybody is just going on about their lives, not really taking a chance to actually think about why we are here in the first place and what our purpose actually is...</p>

    <p>I have gained recogition through popular social media sites such as Instagram and Twitter, leading me onto some amazing oportunities involving professional work with some of the biggest grossing companies throughout Europe and North America, Volkswagen and Timberland being my proudest!</p>

    <p>My main aim with this website is to produce content that I know you'll love as much as I enjoy creating it! Follow me as I take you on a journey throughout the world!
